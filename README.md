# materialized_view_query_containment

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.



## What do we want 

1) Make a simple SpecCS implementation 
2) Adapt it to bag semantic because of federated queries
3) Make a JSAG implementation
4) Adapt it for bag semantic 
5) Make an implementation of Conjunctive query containment revisited
6) Adapt it to bag semantic 

Why not all the other algorithm????


- sparql-Algebra (SA)
- Alternation Free two-way Âµ-calculus (AFMU)
- TreeSolver (TS)
- Query Canonicalisation (QCan)

Why we restrict to not everything???
