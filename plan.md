- Single Conjective queries (CQ)

- Work on a federation context

So the query we send might not need to be fully answer by this data sources.

Possible answer

- We have a single non contradictory match between the query of the user and the query from the view
- We have some knowledge about the content of the data so we can select the subquery from query sent to the user before doing the containment
    - This knowledge simply can be a set of predicates
