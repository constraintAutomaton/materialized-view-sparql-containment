  abstract = {We consider the problems of conjunctive query containment and minimization, which are known to be NP-complete, and show that these problems can be solved in polynomial time for the class of acyclic queries. We then generalize the notion of acyclicity and define a parameter called query width that captures the “degree of cyclicity” of a query: in particular, a query is acyclic if and only if its query width is 1. We give algorithms for containment and minimization that run in time polynomial in nk, where n is the input size and k is the query width. These algorithms naturally generalize those for acyclic queries, and are of practical significance because many queries have small query width compared to their sizes. We show that good bounds on the query width of Q can be obtained using the treewidth of the incidence graph of Q. We then consider the problem of finding an equivalent query to a given conjunctive query Q that has the least number of subgoals. We show that a polynomial-time approximation algorithm is unlikely for this problem. Finally, we apply our containment algorithm to the practically important problem of finding equivalent rewritings of a query using a set of materialized views.},

  abstract = {Chordal graphs arise naturally in the study of Gaussian elimination on sparse symmetric matrices; acyclic hypergraphs arise in the study of relational data bases. Rose, Tarjan and Lueker [SIAM J. Comput., 5 (1976), pp. 266–283] have given a linear-time algorithm to test whether a graph is chordal, which Yannakakis has modified to test whether a hypergraph is acyclic. Here we develop a simplified linear-time test for graph chordality and hypergraph acyclicity. The test uses a new kind of graph (and hypergraph) search, which we call maximum cardinality search A variant of the method gives a way to selectively reduce acyclic hypergraphs, which is needed for evaluating queries in acyclic relational data bases.},

  abstract  = {Query containment and query equivalence constitute important computational problems in the context of static query analysis and optimization. While these problems have been intensively studied for fragments of relational calculus, almost no works exist for the semantic web query language SPARQL. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive complexity analysis of containment and equivalence for several fragments of SPARQL: we start with the fundamental fragment of well-designed SPARQL restricted to the AND and OPTIONAL operator. We then study basic extensions in the form of the UNION operator and/or projection. The results obtained range from NP-completeness to undecidability.},

  abstract  = {Query containment is the problem of deciding if the answers to a query are included in those of another query for any queried database. This problem is very important for query optimization purposes. In the SPARQL context, it can be equally useful. This problem has recently been investigated theoretically and some query containment solvers are available. Yet, there were no benchmarks to compare theses systems and foster their improvement. In order to experimentally assess implementation strengths and limitations, we provide a first SPARQL containment test benchmark. It has been designed with respect to both the capabilities of existing solvers and the study of typical queries. Some solvers support optional constructs and cycles, while other solvers support projection, union of conjunctive queries and RDF Schemas. No solver currently supports all these features or OWL entailment regimes. The study of query demographics on DBPedia logs shows that the vast majority of queries are acyclic and a significant part of them uses UNION or projection. We thus test available solvers on their domain of applicability on three different benchmark suites. These experiments show that (i) tested solutions are overall functionally correct, (ii) in spite of its complexity, SPARQL query containment is practicable for acyclic queries, (iii) state-of-the-art solvers are at an early stage both in terms of capability and implementation.},

We present an approach for solving the query containment problem for SPARQL queries -- the W3C standard query language for RDF datasets. Solving the query containment problem can be reduced to the problem of deciding whether a sub graph isomorphism exists between the normalized algebra expressions of two queries.},
